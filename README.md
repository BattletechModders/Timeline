# Timeline
BattleTech mod that helps ground the campaign into the timeline of the universe.

* Uses a set date as a starting point (configurable in settings)
* Displays the date in the event popup and in the game timeline

## Requires

[BTML](https://github.com/BattletechModders/BattleTechModLoader/releases) and [ModTek](https://github.com/BattletechModders/ModTek/releases) -- [installation guide here](https://github.com/BattletechModders/ModTek/wiki/The-Drop-Dead-Simple-Guide-to-Installing-BTML-&-ModTek-&-ModTek-mods).

## Credits

* Zathoth for the [AddYearToTimeline mod](https://github.com/Zathoth/AddYearToTimeline) that served as inspiration
* HBS for making a great game

## Future Plans

* Add tags to the company/game to allow for time to unlock content (events/mechs/etc.)
* Allow for star systems to change over time based on the BattleTech universe
